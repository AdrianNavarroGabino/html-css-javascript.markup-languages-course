              As promised, today I'm proud to announce that Starbuzz Coffee is launching the Tweet Sip cup, a special Starbuzz Coffee cup that tweets each time you take a sip! Check out my video of our new invention.

            <p>
              Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. 
              In fact, we're going further than any of our competitors and 
              we're very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that 
              links your coffee drinking directly to your social 
              network. Forget "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and 
              with this new product every sip of smooth, aromatic, hot Starbuzz 
              blend is going to to be shared with your social network.
              Sound like science fiction?  It's not; I'm already 
              testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this, 
              which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social 
              networks.  We've made a huge investment to make this happen 
              and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, 
              NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few more things the tech 
              folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).
              So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll 
              be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this 
              new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.

            <p>
              Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee 
              house is? The lines alway move fast, and despite the 
              astronomical number of different drinks any customer can 
              order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the 
              way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it? 
              To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and 
              greatest in computer science.  In fact, we train 
              our staff to be one big distributed computer.  The cashiers 
              create the orders for the distributed computer, complete 
              with your name and the drinks special instructions.  Then 
              our specialized drink makers grab the next cup
              and go about working on your order until it's finished.  
              With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation 
              any time we want.  All we need to do is add more cashiers 
              and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support 
              staff you never see) as the customer flow grows.

              Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a 
              customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order 
              is a "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte, 
              with the splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we 
              have unique customers or what?
